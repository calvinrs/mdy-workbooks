    "We can declare \"docs\" within a document, so that the page set will be included in exactly the same way as if it was requested by the tool. This is \"tripped\" and included in the doc when the Tool is present in the sub-graph of TMT relationships from the caller tool (usually a BHC creator).  \n",

    "Note that this approach - \"include each match for tools\" - will be different to how models are activated, which could be described as \"include one single closest match for models\".\n",

    "All of the dividend yields on the map above represent the different equity calibrations. This \"include each match for tools\" approach may be useful for compiling equity documents - MC equity is next on the list.\n",

    "### And a note of caution\n",
    "\n",
    "The TMT network in its current incarnation is rather greedy - it often pulls back more tools than should be accessable when tracing all models back from a single tool. So we will have to be careful if we implement this that we do not include more than we intend to.\n"

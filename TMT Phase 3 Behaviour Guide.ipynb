    "## Cloning Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need to define what we expect to happen when we \"clone\" a TMT configuration. What we generally mean by \"Clone\" is to *take an existing TMT **Pattern**, and replicate this as something new*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can help to define what a pattern is, by defining some rules about TMT that we want to ensure are not broken when we perform a cloning action:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ TMT configurations are unique for each **Tool Run** - so we must create something new by tweaking at least one part of the Tool's critera so it does not clash with the original.\n",
    "    + Hence **Clone by Stream** and **Clone by Economy** cases - we are referring to the part of the criteria that will change.\n",
    "+ Model Outputs must only come from one source - so the model output of a clone must also have a new criteria\n",
    "    + Keeping this as simple as possible, the best way to achieve this is to change the Stream to match the stream of the tool run.\n",
    "+ For *Economy* clones, we want to extend the changes to any matching **input** model that is also specific to the economy\n",
    "    + i.e. if the tool takes a *USD* YC as an input, clones to other economies should use their own economies yield curve.\n",
    "    + Outputs will almost certainly be economy-specific, so these should be matching too.\n",
    "    + Note that *Economy* behaviour will also be required for *Equity Asset* and *SubModel* behavior too.\n",
    "        + See earlier suggestions that a single Tuple of *(Economy, Asset, SubModel)* is how we should best treat these 3 fields as one\n",
    "    + Any \"economy\"-switching should also apply to the *EconAssetOverride* and *SubModelNameOverride*, if these are set to be economy-specific, rather than the native field. \n",
    "+ We want cloning to be **predictable**  - so keeping enforced changes to a minimum.\n",
    "    + Limiting model changes to what we need to do - i.e. to meet the rules above - is safer than having more complex rules.\n",
    "    + We can always edit calibrations in more detail, using the phase 2 functionality, to get exactly what we want in each specific case.\n",
    "    + In summary - we will not edit the input models any more than we have to - they will retain their original *Stream*, *CalibrationType* and *CurveType* when performing a full clone.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## A BIG QUESTION\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do we want to allow changes to be made to existing TMT configurations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Do we want to make this an explicit option - i.e. include a \"don't change existing TMT\" flag to act as a safety catch?\n",
    "\n",
    "For \"CLONE\", the intention is to create new content - new tool runs and models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For \"APPLY, the intention is to make an edit to an existing config, and broadcast this change to other existing config. So this is always a change to existing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is plenty grey space inbetween these two intended use cases, and I'm not sure if we need to implement something else in addition to the \"cloning rules\".  "

    "Taking into account what we want to do in this phase, I have mocked up what I feel we need to include to access this functionality.  \n",

    "\n",
    "+ Separate sections for **Editing Current Config** and **Cloning Config**\n",
    "+ No hidden buttons - all options should be visible\n",
    "+ \"Remove\" becomes a **Mark for Remove** - this should not happen immediately\n",
    "    + and I guess we will need to indicate in the table what is to be removed\n",
    "    + or alternatively, have some kind of \"delete\" toggle in the table, then there is no need for this button.\n",
    "+ There is only one **\"Commit Changes\"** button\n",
    "    + This will combine all of the <span style=\"color:orange\">orange</span> buttons on the current editor into a single commit.\n",
    "    + The positioning of this button is a bit fishy in the mockup here - it should be positioned so that it is clear that this will perform all actions when clicked (including any cloning instructions).\n",
    "+ The cloning options have been gathered together, and should show all parts of the standard criteria\n",
    "    + This should show what the current criteria is, and what we will be optionally cloning it to.\n",
    "    + If no clone options are selected, then we are effectively just editing the current configuration (like in **phase 2**).\n",
    "    + Some options should allow *Multiple* entries to be selected (like *Economy*) - others should be limited to a single option\n",
    "        + This is indicated by the plurals - the key takeaway is that \"Stream\" is one at a time only.\n",
    "    + The tool name cannot be changed, so does not have a dropdown selector.\n",
    "        + We may want to revisit this later. Tools that use multiple unanchored models could be treated in the same way- i.e. we may want to push out a set of similar changes to a *FullEconomyValidator* and a *BHC Creator* - they work in much the same way in terms of inputs. But no need for this yet.\n",
    "    + Only one of *Economy*, *Equity Asset* and *SubModel* can be chosen for cloning.\n",
    "        + Otherwise, it leads to cross-joining all the combinations, which is unlikely what we want to happen anyway.\n",
    "        + So if one of these selectors gets used, the other 2 should be disabled.\n",
    "        \n",
